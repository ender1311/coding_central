                <h1>My Story</h1>
                <p>I grew up with <span class="highlight_grew">computers and video games.</span> <br/>
                  I built my first computer and my first website at 15.<br/>
                  I learned C++ at 16.
                  
                </p>
                <p>Video games 
                <span class="highlight_inspired">inspired me</span> 
                with stories and connection between characters. 
                  Sadly, I realized I did not have those in reality. 
                  In a world where I was isolated from peers, computers offered a way for me to use my skills but didnâ€™t fulfill the 
                  <span class="highlight_ache">ache for friendships.</span>
                </p>  
                  <p>
                    In college, I discovered the incredible, transformative impact of a community that simply loved and <span class="highlight_value">valued me</span>. 
                  I made many close friendships. 
                  At my wedding, I expanded my group of six groomsmen to include thirty mighty men.

                  </p>                
                  <p>
                    That transformation in college was so profound that I spent the next 15 years working for churches/ non-profits in order to see that incredible transformation work in others.<br/>
                    I <span class="highlight_grew">mentored dozens</span> of next-generation leaders every year.<br>
                    <br/>
                    Recently, I have decided to transition into the tech industry in order to combine my <span class="highlight_inspired">passion for technology</span> with my determination to bring value to as many <span class="highlight_value">precious humans</span> as possible<br/>
                    <br/>
                    I believe that tech can be leveraged for many positive things: quality of life, human connection, time spent with family and friends, and access to goods/services.
